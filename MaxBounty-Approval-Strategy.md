## Business Model Overview

### Platform Concept: Play to Save

**Core Function**: Interactive engagement layer for performance marketing

**Value Proposition**: Gamification-enhanced traffic conditioning that improves conversion rates on cost-per-action (CPA) offers in the insurance and financial services verticals.

### Operational Flow

```
Step 1: Traffic Acquisition
   → Paid social media advertising (Facebook/Instagram)
   → Broad interest targeting in insurance/finance categories

Step 2: Pre-Qualification
   → Basic filtering (age, state, intent)
   → Reduces wasted spend by 30-40%

Step 3: Engagement Layer (Proprietary)
   → Interactive experience (10-second duration)
   → Game mechanics: spin wheels, scratch-offs, prize reveals
   → Psychological priming: dopamine response + commitment bias

Step 4: Offer Presentation
   → Redirect to CPA offer (insurance quote, loan application, etc.)
   → Warm traffic with higher conversion probability

Step 5: Performance Tracking
   → Meta Conversions API integration
   → Real-time optimization and retargeting
```

### Strategic Rationale

**Problem Statement**: Cold social media traffic typically converts poorly on direct financial offers due to lack of engagement and trust.

**Solution**: A brief interactive experience creates positive emotional state and increases user commitment before presenting the core offer.

**Market Positioning**: Traffic arbitrage model leveraging the spread between low-cost social media clicks ($0.20-0.40 CPC) and high-value CPA payouts ($15-60 per conversion).

## Phone Interview Framework

### Opening Statement

*"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my application. I'm building a platform called Play to Save that specializes in performance marketing for the insurance and financial services verticals.
