## 3. Content: First 5 Organic Posts

> All posts should avoid guarantees, gambling language, or exaggerated claims. Use "may" / "might" / "see if you qualify" phrasing.

### Post 1 – Welcome / Positioning

- [ ] 3.1.1 Create copy
  - [ ] Text:
    > 👋 Welcome to Insurance Insights Hub  
    >  
    > We started this page to make insurance easier to understand – starting with **auto insurance**.  
    >  
    > Our focus here is simple:  
    > – Explain how coverage and pricing actually work  
    > – Help you spot when it might be time to compare options  
    > – Connect you with providers that *may* be a better fit for your situation  
    >  
    > If you’ve had a rate increase lately or haven’t checked prices in a while, a quick check‑up can be useful.  
    >  
    > You can start here:  
    > 👉 https://playtosave.net  
    >  
    > No guarantees, just information and options.

### Post 2 – Educational Tip (When to Shop Around)

- [ ] 3.2.1 Create copy
  - [ ] Text:
    > 🚗 **When should you compare auto insurance rates?**  
    >  
    > Many drivers stay with the same company for years and quietly accept price increases. A quick comparison can make sense if:  
    >  
    > – Your premium just went up  
    > – You moved or changed vehicles  
    > – Your credit score improved  
    > – It’s been more than 12 months since you last checked  
    >  
    > Even if you don’t switch, knowing what other companies would charge gives you leverage when negotiating with your current insurer.  
    >  
    > This page is here to share simple, practical insights like this – no hype, just information.

    >  
    > There’s no single "best" company for every driver. Prices can vary a lot based on age, location, driving history, and more.  
    >  
    > We put together a short online questionnaire that:  
    > – Takes about 2 minutes  
    > – Helps you compare offers from multiple providers  
    > – Lets you see if you *might* qualify for a lower rate  
    >  
    > If you’re wondering whether it’s worth checking, you can start here:  
    > 👉 https://playtosave.net  
    >  
    > It’s simply a way to explore options – not a guarantee of savings.

    >  
    > **Myth 2:** Only people with perfect records can save.  
    > **Fact:** Different insurers weigh things differently. Even with a ticket or two, some providers may still offer better options.  
    >  
    > **Myth 3:** Checking quotes will hurt your credit score.  
    > **Fact:** Many online comparisons use soft checks or aggregated data that **don’t** impact your score.
