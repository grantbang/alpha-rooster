# The Decision-Making Brains of the Operation
## How You Actually Choose What to Promote (For Complete Beginners)

---

## The Core Confusion

**You're asking**: "How do I know WHICH insurance offer to promote? WHICH ad to run? WHICH audience to target?"

**The answer**: You DON'T know at first. You TEST everything, then the DATA tells you what works.

This is **not a planning business**, it's a **testing business**.

## Decision Framework: The 3 Levels

### Level 1: WHAT to Promote (The Offer)
### Level 2: WHO to Show It To (The Audience)  
### Level 3: HOW to Present It (The Creative)

Let me explain each...

## LEVEL 1: Deciding WHAT to Promote (The Offer)

```

### How to Pick Your First 3 Offers

**DON'T overthink it. Use this formula:**

#### Filter 1: High Payout
Look for offers paying **$15+ per conversion**. Anything under $10 is too thin.

#### Filter 2: Broad Geographic
**Avoid** offers that say "California only" or "Ages 45-50 only"  
**Choose** offers that say "All US states" or "Age 18+"

Why? You need VOLUME to test. Narrow = expensive.

#### Filter 3: Simple Action
**Good**: "Submit email and zip code"  
**Bad**: "Complete 50-question survey and upload documents"

The easier the conversion, the higher your conversion rate.

### Your Week 1 Strategy

**Pick 3 offers from 3 different categories:**

1. **Auto Insurance** (Example: Progressive, GEICO aggregator)
2. **Personal Loan** (Example: LendingTree, SoFi)  
3. **Life Insurance** (Example: SelectQuote, Bestow)

**Why 3?** 
- If #1 flops, you have #2 and #3 as backups
- Different audiences respond to different offers
- Diversification = lower risk

### The Testing Matrix (Week 1)

```
Monday-Tuesday: Auto Insurance Offer
  - Budget: $50 total
  - Goal: Get 5-10 conversions
  - Track: Which ad/audience works best

Wednesday-Thursday: Personal Loan Offer
  - Budget: $50 total
  - Goal: Get 5-10 conversions
  - Compare to auto insurance results

Friday-Sunday: Life Insurance Offer
  - Budget: $50 total
  - Goal: Get 5-10 conversions
  - Final comparison

TOTAL WEEK 1 SPEND: $150
```

### How You Decide the "Winner"

After Week 1, you calculate **EPC (Earnings Per Click)**:

```
Auto Insurance:
  - Spent: $50
  - Clicks: 150
  - Conversions: 8
  - Revenue: 8 × $18 = $144
  - EPC: $144 ÷ 150 clicks = $0.96 per click
  - Profit: $144 - $50 = $94 ✅ WINNER

Personal Loan:
  - Spent: $50
  - Clicks: 120
  - Conversions: 3
  - Revenue: 3 × $25 = $75
  - EPC: $75 ÷ 120 clicks = $0.63 per click
  - Profit: $75 - $50 = $25 ✅ Marginal

Life Insurance:
  - Spent: $50
  - Clicks: 140
  - Conversions: 1
  - Revenue: 1 × $32 = $32
  - EPC: $32 ÷ 140 clicks = $0.23 per click
  - Profit: $32 - $50 = -$18 ❌ LOSER
```

**Decision**: 
- **Scale** auto insurance to $100/day (it's profitable)
- **Keep testing** personal loans (break-even, might improve)
- **Kill** life insurance (losing money)

---

## LEVEL 2: Deciding WHO to Show It To (The Audience)

### The Audience Testing Process

You DON'T know which audience will convert. So you test 3-5 different audiences **simultaneously**.

### Week 1 Audience Tests (for Auto Insurance offer)

**Ad Set 1: Interest - GEICO**
```
Age: 25-65
Location: United States
Interests: GEICO
Budget: $10/day
```

**Ad Set 2: Interest - Car Ownership**
```
Age: 25-55
Location: United States
Behaviors: Car ownership
Budget: $10/day
```

**Ad Set 3: Demographic - Homeowners**
```
Age: 30-55
Location: United States
Behaviors: Homeowners
Budget: $10/day
```

**Ad Set 4: Life Event - Recent Movers**
```
Age: 25-50
Location: United States
Life Events: Recently moved
Budget: $10/day
```

**Ad Set 5: Broad - Financial Interest**
```
Age: 25-65
Location: United States
Interests: Personal finance, saving money
Budget: $10/day
```

**TOTAL: $50/day across 5 ad sets**

### After 3 Days, You Check Results

```
Ad Set 1 (GEICO Interest):
  - Spent: $30
  - Conversions: 4
  - Cost per conversion: $7.50
  - EPC: $1.20
  - Status: ✅ WINNER - Scale to $20/day

Ad Set 2 (Car Ownership):
  - Spent: $30
  - Conversions: 2
  - Cost per conversion: $15
  - EPC: $0.60
  - Status: ⚠️ Keep testing at $10/day

Ad Set 3 (Homeowners):
  - Spent: $30
  - Conversions: 3
  - Cost per conversion: $10
  - EPC: $0.90
  - Status: ✅ Scale to $15/day

Ad Set 4 (Recent Movers):
  - Spent: $30
  - Conversions: 0
  - Cost per conversion: N/A
  - EPC: $0
  - Status: ❌ KILL - Pause immediately

Ad Set 5 (Financial Interest):
  - Spent: $30
  - Conversions: 1
  - Cost per conversion: $30
  - EPC: $0.30
  - Status: ❌ KILL - Not profitable
```

**Decision**:
- Kill Ad Sets 4 and 5 (losing money)
- Scale Ad Set 1 to $20/day (best performer)
- Scale Ad Set 3 to $15/day (profitable)
- Keep Ad Set 2 at $10/day (might improve)
- **New budget**: $45/day (down from $50, but more efficient)

### The "Brains" Here

**You're not guessing.** The data tells you:
- GEICO interest audience converts best → Focus there
- Recent movers don't convert → Stop wasting money
- Homeowners are decent → Keep but don't over-invest

---

## LEVEL 3: Deciding HOW to Present It (The Creative)

### The Creative Testing Process

Even with the right offer and audience, **the ad matters**. You test multiple styles.

### Week 1 Creative Tests (for GEICO Interest audience)

## The Weekly Decision Loop

Here's what you ACTUALLY do every week:

### Monday Morning: Review Weekend Data

**Open your spreadsheet:**
```
┌────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────┐
│ Offer      │ Audience│ Creative│ Spent    │ Convs   │ EPC  │ Action │
├────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────┼────────┤
│ Auto Ins   │ GEICO   │ A       │ $60      │ 8       │ $1.20│ SCALE  │
│ Auto Ins   │ GEICO   │ E       │ $60      │ 6       │ $0.90│ KEEP   │
│ Auto Ins   │ Car Own │ A       │ $30      │ 2       │ $0.60│ KEEP   │
│ Auto Ins   │ Movers  │ A       │ $30      │ 0       │ $0.00│ KILL   │
│ Loan       │ Finance │ B       │ $50      │ 3       │ $0.75│ KEEP   │
│ Life Ins   │ Seniors │ D       │ $50      │ 1       │ $0.32│ KILL   │
└────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────┴────────┘
```

### Your Decisions (Based on EPC)

**Rule 1: EPC > $1.00 = SCALE**
- Increase budget by 50-100%
- This combo is profitable, milk it

**Rule 2: EPC $0.50-$1.00 = KEEP TESTING**
- Might improve with more data
- Don't scale, but don't kill yet

**Rule 3: EPC < $0.50 = KILL**
- Pause ad set immediately
- You're losing money

### Monday Actions:

```
✅ SCALE:
  - Auto Insurance + GEICO + Creative A
  - Action: Increase budget from $60/week to $120/week

⚠️ KEEP:
  - Auto Insurance + Car Ownership + Creative A
  - Auto Insurance + GEICO + Creative E  
  - Loan + Finance + Creative B
  - Action: Keep current budgets, monitor

❌ KILL:
  - Auto Insurance + Movers + Creative A
  - Life Insurance + Seniors + Creative D
  - Action: Pause these ad sets, reallocate budget to winners
```

### Tuesday-Thursday: Monitor

**Just check once per day:**
- Are the scaled campaigns still profitable?
- Any new losers to kill?
- Any surprises (sudden spike or drop)?

### Friday: Plan Next Week's Tests

**Look for gaps:**
- "GEICO interest worked, what about Progressive interest?"
- "Spin wheel creative worked, what about scratch-off?"
- "Auto insurance worked, what about home insurance?"

**Create 3 new tests for next week:**
```
New Test 1: Auto Insurance + Progressive Interest + Creative A
Budget: $30
Goal: See if Progressive converts like GEICO did

New Test 2: Auto Insurance + GEICO + Creative F (new scratch-off)
Budget: $30
Goal: See if scratch-off beats spin wheel

New Test 3: Home Insurance + Homeowners + Creative A
Budget: $30
Goal: Expand to new vertical
```

## The "Brains" Summarized

### You DON'T decide based on:
- ❌ Gut feeling
- ❌ What "sounds good"
- ❌ Random guessing
- ❌ What worked for someone else

### You DO decide based on:
- ✅ **EPC (Earnings Per Click)** - The #1 metric
- ✅ **Conversion Rate** - Are people completing the offer?
- ✅ **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** - Are people clicking your ad?
- ✅ **Cost Per Conversion** - How much does each lead cost?

### The Simple Formula

```
IF EPC > Your CPC (cost per click):
  ↳ You're profitable → SCALE

IF EPC < Your CPC:
  ↳ You're losing money → KILL

IF EPC ≈ Your CPC:
  ↳ Break-even → KEEP TESTING (might improve)
```

### Example:

```
Auto Insurance Offer:
  - Payout: $18 per conversion
  - Your CPC: $0.40
  - Conversion rate: 5%
  
Math:
  - Out of 100 clicks ($40 spent):
    → 5 conversions × $18 = $90 revenue
    → EPC = $90 ÷ 100 clicks = $0.90 per click
  
Decision:
  - EPC ($0.90) > CPC ($0.40) → PROFITABLE
  - Profit per 100 clicks: $90 - $40 = $50
  - Action: SCALE THIS IMMEDIATELY
```

## Common Beginner Questions

### Q: "How do I know which offer will work BEFORE I test it?"
**A: You don't.** That's the point. Testing IS the strategy.

### Q: "Can't I just copy what someone else is doing?"
**A: No.** Their audience, creative, and timing are different. What worked for them 6 months ago might not work for you today.

### Q: "What if I waste money testing?"
**A: Budget for it.** Expect to lose $100-300 in Week 1 testing. That's your "market research" cost. By Week 2, you'll know what works.

### Q: "How long do I test before killing something?"
**A: 100 clicks or $30 spent, whichever comes first.** If no conversions by then, it's dead.

### Q: "What if NOTHING works?"
**A: Rare, but possible.** Likely causes:
- Your game is broken (check fraud score)
- Your targeting is wrong (too broad or too narrow)
- Your creative sucks (test more variations)
- The offer doesn't match the audience (try different verticals)

## Bottom Line: The Decision Algorithm

**Every Monday, you ask 3 questions:**

1. **"Which combos made money last week?"** → Scale those
2. **"Which combos lost money?"** → Kill those  
3. **"What new tests should I try?"** → Fill 30% of budget with experiments

**The data decides. Not you.**

Your job is to:
1. Set up tests
2. Collect data
3. Do the math
4. Follow the rules (scale/keep/kill)
5. Repeat

**That's the "brains" of the operation.** Simple, systematic, data-driven.

No magic. No guessing. Just test → measure → optimize → repeat.
