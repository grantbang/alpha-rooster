Here is your mechanical blueprint. This is designed to be executed linearly. Do not skip steps.The "Mechanical Arbitrage" BlueprintObjective: Profitable Lead Generation via Facebook Ads $\to$ MaxBountyCapital Allocation: $20,000 (Float) | Risk Tolerance: Low (White Hat Only)Phase 1: Infrastructure Build (Days 1-3)The machine must be built before it is turned on.1. Server-Side Tracking (CAPI) with DeduplicationYou are not just sending data; you are ensuring Facebook counts every user exactly once.The Mechanism: Generate a unique event_id (UUID) for every page load on your bridge page.The Browser Event: Fire the standard Pixel ViewContent or Lead event and include this event_id.The Server Event: Send a POST request to Facebook’s Graph API with the same event_id.The Result: Facebook sees two signals, matches the IDs, and merges them into one accurate data point.2. The "Bridge" Page ConstructionDomain: Buy a generic, trustworthy URL (e.g., HomeSavingsTips.com, SmartRateFinder.com).Hosting: Deploy your bridge page (Python/Flask/Django or static site) on a fast server. Speed is a ranking factor.The "Safe" Footer:Links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact Us, DMCA.Mandatory Disclaimer: "This site is not a part of the Facebook website or Facebook Inc. Additionally, This site is NOT endorsed by Facebook in any way. FACEBOOK is a trademark of FACEBOOK, Inc."3. Email/Domain ValidationBusiness Manager: Verify your domain inside Facebook Business Manager (DNS TXT record).Support Email: Create support@yourdomain.com. Ensure it works.Phase 2: Account Seasoning (Days 4-7)Facebook bans new accounts that spend big money immediately. You must look like a normal business first.1. The Content LayerCreate a Facebook Business Page matching your domain name.Upload a high-quality logo and cover photo (use Canva/Midjourney).Post 3 Generic Posts:Tip: "How to save money on [Topic]."Question: "What’s the hardest part about [Topic]?"Fact: "Did you know [Statistic]?"2. The "Burn" SpendCampaign: "Page Likes" or "Engagement".Budget: $5/day.Duration: 3 Days.Goal: Spend $15 total. This authorizes your credit card and proves you are not a bot.Phase 3: The Input Selection (Strategy)1. Offer Selection (MaxBounty)Category: Home Services (Roofing, Windows, Solar) or Insurance (Auto, Life).Metric: EPC (Earnings Per Click) must be > $1.00.Type: CPL (Cost Per Lead). Avoid CPS (Cost Per Sale).2. Creative Generation (AI)Angle 1 (Logic): Focus on the financial savings or ROI.Angle 2 (Pain/Fear): Focus on the problem (e.g., "Leaky roof? Rates rising?").Angle 3 (Curiosity): A "weird" fact or a question.Output: Generate 3 distinct images/videos and 2 scripts using Midjourney/ChatGPT.Phase 4: The Launch Configuration (The 3:2:2)Standardize this. Do not deviate.Campaign SettingsObjective: Sales (or Leads).Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO): OFF. (Manage budget at Ad Set level for control).Ad Set SettingsConversion Location: Your Website (Bridge Page).Pixel Event: "Lead" or "Purchase" (Triggered by the CAPI postback).Targeting: Broad (Age 25-65+, US Only). Do not add interests. Let the algorithm find the buyers.Placements: Advantage+ (Automatic).Ad Level (Dynamic Creative)Turn "Dynamic Creative" ON.Select:3 Images/Videos (The visual inputs).2 Primary Texts (The copy inputs).2 Headlines (The click drivers).Phase 5: The Operating Logic (Daily Routine)1. The Launch RuleCreate campaigns in the evening.Schedule them to go live at 12:00 AM (Ad Account Time).2. The "Hold" RuleFirst 48 Hours: DO NOT TOUCH. No pausing, no editing. Let it run.3. The "Kill" Rule (Stop Loss)Calculate the Offer Payout (e.g., $40).Rule: If Ad Set Spend > (2 x Payout) AND Leads = 0 $\rightarrow$ TURN OFF.Example: Spent $80, 0 Leads. Kill.4. The "Scale" RuleRule: If ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is positive (e.g., spent $50, made $75).Action: Increase budget by 20%.Frequency: Once every 48 hours.Master ChecklistInfrastructure[ ] Domain purchased & verified in FB Business Manager.[ ] Bridge page deployed (Fast load speed).[ ] CAPI code implemented with Deduplication logic (event_id).[ ] Footer Disclaimer added (Copy/Paste exact text).[ ] Privacy Policy, ToS, and Contact pages created & linked.Warm Up[ ] Facebook Page created (Logo/Cover photo uploaded).[ ] 3 Generic posts published.[ ] Credit Card added to Ad Account.[ ] "Page Like" Campaign run for 3 days ($15 spend).Campaign Setup[ ] Offer selected (EPC > $1.00, White Hat).[ ] 3 Distinct Angles defined (Logic, Fear, Curiosity).[ ] 3 Images/Videos generated via AI.[ ] 2 Copy variations written.[ ] Campaign scheduled for 12:00 AM launch.Execution[ ] Day 1-2: Do nothing.
