## 📞 What They'll Ask (And Your Answers)

### **"Tell me about your business model"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I run **gamified landing pages** that drive traffic to CPA offers using **Facebook and TikTok ads**. Users play a quick interactive game—like a spin wheel—and when they win, they're directed to the advertiser's offer. It increases engagement and conversion rates compared to direct linking."

**Why this works:** Shows you understand traffic + funnels + conversion optimization.

---

### **"What traffic sources do you use?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "Primarily **Facebook and Instagram ads**, with plans to test **TikTok ads**. I buy traffic on a CPC basis, usually $0.30-$0.60 per click, and optimize based on EPC (earnings per click) data."

**Why this works:** Shows you know paid traffic and performance metrics.

---

### **"How much traffic do you plan to send?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I'm starting with a **$20-$30/day test budget** to validate offers and optimize my funnel. Once I find winning combinations, I'll scale to **$100-$300/day** per offer. My goal is to send **500-1,500 clicks per week** initially."

**Why this works:** Conservative start, but shows scaling intent.

---

### **"Do you have experience with CPA marketing?"**

**Your Answer (pick one based on truth):**

**If you're new:**
> "This is my first CPA network, but I've been **studying performance marketing** and built my entire tech stack specifically for this—tracking pixels, conversion APIs, analytics dashboards. I'm treating this like a serious business, not a side hustle."

**If you have some experience:**
> "I've tested affiliate offers before with [previous network/method], and now I'm focused on **scaling with a professional funnel and tracking system**."

**Why this works:** Honesty + seriousness = trustworthy.

---

### **"Can I see your website?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "Absolutely! **https://playtosave.net** is live. Right now it's a coming-soon page because I'm in the final stages of deploying my interactive game app. I can walk you through my funnel architecture if you'd like—I've built it with FastAPI, BigQuery analytics, and Meta Pixel tracking."

**Why this works:** Shows you're not sketchy + you're technical.

---

### **"How will you promote offers?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I run **curiosity-driven video ads** on Facebook that lead to my gamified landing page. Users interact with the game, and when they 'win,' they're directed to the offer with their click ID tracked. I use **server-side conversion tracking** via Meta CAPI to ensure accurate attribution."

**Why this works:** Shows you understand the full funnel + compliance.

---

### **"What verticals are you interested in?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I'm most interested in **auto insurance**, **personal loans**, and **home services** because they have broad appeal, high payouts, and work well with social traffic. I'd love recommendations on 2-3 beginner-friendly offers in those verticals to start testing."

**Why this works:** Shows you've researched + asks for their expertise.

---

### **"Are you familiar with compliance rules?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "Yes. I never make income guarantees in my ads, I match ad creative to landing page content, and I include all required disclosures. I also built privacy policy and terms of service pages specifically for affiliate marketing compliance."

**Why this works:** Shows you won't get them in trouble.
